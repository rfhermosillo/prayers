a partial indulgence is granted for its use in other circumstances.}
Most sweet Jesus, Whose overflowing charity for men is requited by so much forgetfulness, negligence, and contempt, behold us prostrate before You, eager to repair by a special act of homage the cruel indifference and injuries to which Your loving Heart is everywhere subjected.
Mindful, alas! that we ourselves have had a share in such great indignities, which we now deplore from the depths of our hearts, we humbly ask Your pardon and declare our readiness to atone by voluntary expiation, not only for our own personal offenses, but also for the sins of those who, straying far from the path of salvation, refuse in their obstinate infidelity to follow You, their Shepherd and Leader, or, renouncing the promises of their Baptism, have cast off the sweet yoke of Your Law.

We are now resolved to expiate each and every deplorable outrage committed against You; we are determined to make amends for the manifold offenses against Christian modesty in indecent dress and behavior, for all the foul seductions laid to ensnare the feet of the innocent, for the frequent violations of Sundays and holydays, and for the shocking blasphemies uttered against You and Your Saints.
We wish also to make amends for the insults to which Your Vicar on earth and Your priests are subjected, for the profanation, by conscious neglect or terrible acts of sacrilege, of the very Sacrament of Your divine Love, and lastly for the public crimes of nations who
resist the rights and teaching authority of the Church which You have founded.

Would that we were able to wash away such abominations with our blood.
We now offer, in reparation for these violations of Your divine Honor, the satisfaction You once made to Your Eternal Father on the cross and which You continue to renew daily on our altars;
we offer it in union with the acts of atonement of Your Virgin Mother and all the saints and of the pious faithful on earth;
and we sincerely promise to make recompense, as far as we can with the help of Your Grace, for all neglect of Your great Love and for the sins we and others have committed in the past.
Henceforth, we will live a life of unswerving faith, of purity of conduct, of perfect observance of the precepts of the Gospel and especially that of charity.
We promise to the best of our power to prevent others from offending You and to bring as many as possible to follow You.

O loving Jesus, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mother, our model in reparation, deign to receive the voluntary offering we make of this act of expiation;
and by the crowning gift of perseverance keep us faithful unto death in our duty and the allegiance we owe to You, that we may all one day come to that happy home, where with the Father and the Holy Spirit You live and reign, for ever and ever. Amen.

Most sweet Jesus, Redeemer of the human race, look down upon us humbly prostrate before You.
We are Yours, and Yours we wish to be;
but to be more surely united with You, behold each one of us freely consecrates himself today to Your Most Sacred Heart.
Many indeed have never known You;
many, too, despising Your precepts, have rejected You.
Have mercy on them all, most merciful Jesus, and draw them to Your Sacred Heart.
Be King, O Lord, not only of the faithful who have never forsaken You, but also of the prodigal children who have abandoned You;
grant that they may quickly return to their Father's house, lest they die of wretchedness and hunger.
Be King of those who are deceived by erroneous opinions, or whom discord keeps aloof, and call them back to the harbor of truth and the unity of faith, so that soon there may be but one flock and one Shepherd.
Grant, O Lord, to Your Church assurance of freedom and immunity from harm;
give tranquility of order to all nations;
make the earth resound from pole to pole with one cry:
Praise to the divine Heart that wrought our salvation;
to it be glory and honor for ever.
Amen.
