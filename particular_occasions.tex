\indulgencedprayertitle{\foreign{Adsumus}}
\linkednote{grant26}{A partial indulgence is granted for devoutly offering prayer of supplication such as this one when starting and completing work, which is said before a meeting dealing with matters of common interest.}
We have come, O Lord, Holy Spirit, we have come before You, hampered indeed by our many and grievous sins, but for a special purpose gathered together in Your Name.
Come to us, be with us, and enter our hearts.
Teach us what we are to do and what ought to concern us;
show us what we must accomplish, in order that, with Your help, we may be able to please You in all things.
May You alone be the author and the finisher of our judgments, Who alone with God the Father and His Son possess a glorious Name.
Do not allow us to disturb the order of justice, You Who love equity above all things.
Let not ignorance draw us into devious paths.
Let not partiality sway our minds or respect of riches or persons pervert our judgment.
But unite our hearts to You by the gift of Your Grace alone, that we may be one in You and never forsake the truth;
as we are gathered together in Your Name, so may we in all things hold fast to justice tempered by mercy, that in this life our judgment may never be at variance with You and in the life to come we may attain to everlasting rewards for deeds well done.
Amen.

Look down upon us, have mercy on us, and deliver us from the trouble that now besets us.
Deal with us not according to our iniquities, but according to Your manifold Mercies, for we are the works of Your Hands and You know our weaknesses.
We pray to You to grant us Your divine helping Grace, and endow us with patience and strength to endure our hardships with complete submission to Your Will.
Only You know our misery and sufferings, and to You, our only hope and refuge, we flee for relief and comfort, trusting in Your infinite Love and Compassion, that in due time, when You know best, You will deliver us from this trouble, and turn our distress into comfort.
