Most sweet Jesus, whose overflowing charity for men is requited by so much forgetfulness, negligence, and contempt, behold us prostrate before You, eager to repair by a special act of homage the cruel indifference and injuries to which Your loving Heart is everywhere subjected.
Mindful, alas! that we ourselves have had a share in such great indignities, which we now deplore from the depths of our hearts, we humbly ask Your pardon and declare our readiness to atone by voluntary expiation, not only for our own personal offenses, but also for the sins of those who, straying far from the path of salvation, refuse in their obstinate infidelity to follow you, their Shepherd and Leader, or, renouncing the promises of their Baptism, have cast off the sweet yoke of Your law.

We are now resolved to expiate each and every deplorable outrage committed against you; we are determined to make amends for the manifold offenses against Christian modesty in indecent dress and behavior, for all the foul seductions laid to ensnare the feet of the innocent, for the frequent violations of Sundays and holydays, and for the shocking blasphemies uttered against You and Your Saints.
We wish also to make amends for the insults to which Your Vicar on earth and Your priests are subjected, for the profanation, by conscious neglect or terrible acts of sacrilege, of the very Sacrament of Your divine love, and lastly for the public crimes of nations who
resist the rights and teaching authority of the Church which You have founded.

Would that we were able to wash away such abominations with our blood.
We now offer, in reparation for these violations of Your divine honor, the satisfaction You once made to your Eternal Father on the cross and which You continue to renew daily on our altars;
we offer it in union with the acts of atonement of Your Virgin Mother and all the saints and of the pious faithful on earth;
and we sincerely promise to make recompense, as far as we can with the help of Your grace, for all neglect of Your great love and for the sins we and others have committed in the past.
Henceforth, we will live a life of unswerving faith, of purity of conduct, of perfect observance of the precepts of the Gospel and especially that of charity.
We promise to the best of our power to prevent others from offending You and to bring as many as possible to follow You.

O loving Jesus, through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mother, our model in reparation, deign to receive the voluntary offering we make of this act of expiation;
and by the crowning gift of perseverance keep us faithful unto death in our duty and the allegiance we owe to You, that we may all one day come to that happy home, where with the Father and the Holy Spirit You live and reign, for ever and ever. Amen.

We are Yours, and Yours we wish to be;

many, too, despising Your precepts, have rejected You.
Have mercy on them all, most merciful Jesus, and draw them to Your Sacred Heart.
Be King, O Lord, not only of the faithful who have never forsaken You, but also of the prodigal children who have abandoned You;
grant that they may quickly return to their Father's house, lest they die of wretchedness and hunger.
Be King of those who are deceived by erroneous opinions, or whom discord keeps aloof, and call them back to the harbor of truth and the unity of faith, so that soon there may be but one flock and one Shepherd.
Grant, O Lord, to Your Church assurance of freedom and immunity from harm;
give tranquility of order to all nations;
make the earth resound from pole to pole with one cry:
Praise to the divine Heart that wrought our salvation;
to it be glory and honor for ever.

Lord God, I thank You today for the gift of my life, and for the lives of all my brothers and sisters.
I know there is nothing that destroys more life than abortion, yet I rejoice that You have conquered death by the Resurrection of Your Son. 
I am ready to do my part in ending abortion. Today I commit myself 
never to be silent, 
never to be passive, 
never to be forgetful of the unborn. 
I commit myself to be active in the pro-life movement and never to stop defending life until all my brothers and sisters are protected, and our nation once again becomes a nation with liberty and justice not just for some, but for all.
Through Christ our Lord. Amen!

Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
You have filled us with Your Holy Spirit who is our advocate in the heavens, and You have made us advocates for the weakest of all, the unborn.

Your Son has promised us that we will be hated on account of His Name and persecuted for the good that we do.
We ask You today to bless all of us who are advocates for life.
Bless every facet and activity of the pro-life movement, and grant us strength and perseverance in this cause, no matter what the obstacles.

Bless all those who have assisted in the effort to expose the abortion industry, through projects in the past and in the present.

Give them, and all of us who work in this great movement, the protection of Your Providence and the peace and joy that come only from You, and that nobody can take from us.

We pray in the name of Jesus our Lord. Amen.

% Fr. Frank Pavone, National Director, Priests for Life, http://www.priestsforlife.org/pdf/prayer-for-our-public-officials.pdf
Lord Jesus,
You are the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
You are the ruler of the Kings of the earth, and the one through whom and for whom all things exist.

We pray today for those who serve in public office.
We ask that those who write and pass our laws may keep their eyes fixed on Your law as their ultimate authority.
We ask that those who execute the laws may be filled with awe in Your presence, as You govern the universe from end to end mightily.
And we ask that those who judge in human courts may know they are accountable to You, the Judge of all.

Lord, we pray that the tragedy of abortion, and the trade in baby body parts, may awaken the consciences of those in public office, and stir them to action to defend human rights and dignity.

Lord, so many have been asleep, and so many public servants have forgotten the difference between serving the public and killing the public.

Awaken them, enlighten them, and heal them.

And to those whose eyes are already fixed on Your law of life, give unending courage and perseverance in the task of serving the common good and securing the right to life, which comes only from You and which no government can take away.

We ask this of You, Lord Jesus, who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen.

You shared our life and death, our childhood and adulthood.

You also shared our time in the womb. While still God, while worshiped and adored by the angels, while Almighty and filling every part of the universe, You dwelt for nine months in the womb of Mary.
You were our Redeemer in the womb, our God who was a preborn child.

Lord Jesus, we ask You to bless and protect the children who today are in their mothers' womb.
Save them from the danger of abortion.
Give their mothers the grace to sacrifice themselves, in body and soul, for their children.
Help all people to recognize in the preborn child a brother, a sister, saved by You, our Redeemer in the womb.

O Holy Spirit of God, You were promised to us by the Lord Jesus as an Advocate, as one who pleads our cause and speaks up for us in the heights of heaven.
``I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever...'' (John 14:16).

The apostle Paul has taught us that You intercede for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in speech (Rom. 8:26).

We praise You today for the gift of salvation, for we are deeply aware that we cannot save ourselves.
We have sinned, and we cannot win forgiveness on our own.
We need an Advocate.

We ask You, O Holy Spirit, to make us ever more aware of those who need us as advocates.
Grant that we may hear the cries of our youngest, smallest brothers and sisters, those still in the womb, who cannot speak or defend themselves, and who cannot even pray.

Holy Spirit, as You are the Advocate, so make us advocates.
As You hear our cries for mercy, so let us hear the cries of others for mercy.
Save us from the misfortune of seeking mercy only for ourselves, while being deaf to others.
As You loosened the tongues of the apostles at Pentecost, so grant us today a Pentecost for the unborn, that we may speak for them before the great and the small, before governments and institutions, and before all Your people.
Amen.

\prayertitle{To the Virgin Mary}
O Mary, Mother of Jesus and Mother of us all, we turn to you today as the one who said ``Yes'' to Life.
``You will conceive and bear a Son,'' the angel told you.
Despite the surprise and the uncertainty about how this could be, you said yes.
``Be it done unto me according to your word.''

Mary, we pray today for all mothers who are afraid to be mothers.
We pray for those who feel threatened and overwhelmed by their pregnancy.
Intercede for them, that God may give them the grace to say yes and the courage to go on.
May they have the grace to reject the false solution of abortion.
May they say with you, ``Be it done unto me according to your word.''
May they experience the help of Christian people, and know the peace that comes from doing God's will.
Amen.

During this holy season of Lent, a time of both penance and great hope, stir in our hearts a greater love for You and for each other.
During these 40 days of spiritual renewal, lead us to a deeper conversion so that by living in Your light and love we may bear witness to the gift of life.

Lord Jesus, the firstborn of all creation, have mercy on us. 
Accept our prayers and our fasting in atonement for the tragic sin of abortion. 
By the merits of Your precious blood, shed for our redemption, instill in all hearts a profound respect for the gift of life and bring about an end to abortion, euthanasia, and every other assault on innocent human life.

Reawaken in the heart of every pregnant mother a profound love for the life growing in her womb and grant to her unfailing courage to choose life for her child.

Come Holy Spirit, strengthen us and give us fortitude to work tirelessly to promote a true Culture of Life, a culture that recognizes the dignity and sanctity of every person.
Raise up men and women to serve in public office who will enact laws which will safeguard and protect all human life.

Blessed Mary, Mother of God, you bore the Author of Life in your womb. 
Through your intercession may our hearts be conformed to yours so that we might accept, nurture, and cherish all human life.

\appendix
\section{References to the Manual of Indulgences}
\subsection{Relevant Norms}
\newcommand{\norm}[1]{\textbf{N#1.}\newline}
\newcommand{\subnorm}[1]{§#1.}
\norm{1}
An indulgence is a remission before God of the temporal punishment for sins, whose guilt is forgiven, which a properly disposed member of the Christian faithful obtains under certain and clearly defined conditions through the intervention of the Church, which, as the minister of Redemption, dispenses and applies authoritatively the treasury of the expiatory works of Christ and the saints.

\norm{3}
The faithful can obtain partial or plenary indulgences for themselves, or they can apply them to the dead by way of suffrage.

\norm{17}
\subnorm{1} In order to be capable of gaining indulgences one must be baptized, not excommunicated, and in the state of grace at least at the completion of the prescribed works.

\subnorm{2} To gain an indulgence, one must have at least the general intention of doing so and must carry out the enjoined works at the stated time and in due fashion, according to the sense of the grant.

\norm{18}
\subnorm{1} A plenary indulgence can be acquired only once in the course of a day; a partial indulgence can be acquired multiple times.

\subnorm{2} The faithful however can obtain the plenary indulgence at the hour of death, even if they have already gained one on the same day.

\norm{20}
\subnorm{1} To gain a plenary indulgence, in addition to excluding all attachment to sin, even venial sin, it is necessary to perform the indulgenced work and fulfill the following three conditions:
sacramental confession, Eucharistic Communion, and prayer for the intention of the Sovereign Pontiff.

\subnorm{2} A single sacramental confession suffices for gaining several plenary indulgences;
but Holy Communion must be received and prayer for the intention of the Holy Father must be recited for the gaining of each plenary indulgence.

\subnorm{3} The three conditions may be fulfilled several days before or after the performance of the prescribed work;
it is, however, fitting that Communion be received and the prayer for the intention of the Holy Father be said on the same day the work is performed.

\subnorm{4} If the full disposition is lacking, or if the work and the three prescribed conditions are not fulfilled, saving the provisions given in Norm 24 and in Norm 25 regarding those who are ``impeded,'' the indulgence will only be partial.

\subnorm{5} The condition of praying for the intention of the Holy Father is fully satisfied by reciting one Our Father and one Hail Mary;
nevertheless, one has the option of reciting any other prayer according to individual piety and devotion, if recited for this intention.

\norm{22} An indulgence attached to a prayer can be acquired by reciting the prayer in any language, provided that the translation is approved by the competent ecclesiastical authority.

\norm{23} To gain an indulgence it is sufficient to recite the prayer alternately with a companion or to follow it mentally while it is being recited by another.
